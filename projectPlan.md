# Project Plan - Features of E.T.A.

### Graph
A graph that updates in real-time using the D3.js library; this graph will have itâ€™s data generated by students clicking a button on the page when they do not understand a concept explained in class, which will be plotted against time (the y-axis being number of students confused, x-axis being the time at which the students were confused). 

### Chat
A chat feature that allows students and TA's to communicate during lectures. It will use the Live Chat API. To ensure that the chat does not get spammed during the lecture, TA's will have moderator positions to monitor the chat. Additionally, we will be using the Facebook or JavaMail APIs to facilitate logins.

### Lecture Recording
Lectures will be documented on the professor's personal page. This will allow students, as well as professors, to access past lecture material.

### Audio Recording
Professors will be able to record their lecture's audio. These audio files will be available to students for playback. This is accomplished through the built in Java feature of recording audio. The files will be saved to the professor's personal page.

### Professor Resources
Professors will be able to view and download lecture notes and chat logs of previous lectures. They will also be able to set lectures live allowing students to join and see the lecture in real time.
