Many schools are admitting more and more students, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for professors to answer all the questions every student may have in a lecture. Wouldn't it be great if a professor could find out which topics the class was most confused on in real-time, and be able to respond to these questions in class? Explain That Again is an easy-to-use tool that allows professors to do just that! 

What's Explain That Again? 

Explain that Again is a web-based educational tool that allows students to ask questions and give feedback on lectures in real-time, and have their questions answered by other students or TAs in real time without disturbing the rest of the class. It also allows professors to gauge the understanding of the class, which allows them to stop and explain concepts that the class is confused on. Analytics can also be done on the data given by the students, allowing the teacher to see which concepts were explained well and which concepts the class may need more time on. 

What Can It Do? 

Explain That Again focuses on allowing professors and teaching assistants to better understand which material the class understands and which it doesn't. Some of its main features are: 

- Real-time visualization of student feedback 
- Chat system for students and TA's 
- Record lectures and make them available for student download 
- Transcribed lecture recordings 
- In-class quizzes 
- File sharing

CS 2212 - Software Engineering 
Winter 2017 
University of Western Ontario 

CS 2212 allows students in Western Universityâ€™s computer science department to gain experience in planning and developing software in teams similar to real-life programming environments. The project is a Java-based web app, which uses 3rd party APIs to create a full-featured experience that has the potential for release once the course is complete. Throughout the term, students also learn how to apply common software engineering techniques to their projects, and why these techniques are important in development. These techniques include source control, UML, Agile methodologies, and common software design patterns. 

Group 14 has chosen to develop Explain That Again, a real-time data collection and visualization software to help teachers be better able to determine what topics are most confusing their students.
