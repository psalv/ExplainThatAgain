#### Explain That Again
Our project is centered around creating an educational tool that would be used by professors to receive real-time feedback about their lectures, and students for interacting with lectures. This will be a web-based application to provide accessibility to students during lectures. The main feature of the website is a real time graph that whose data is generated by students clicking a button on the page when they do not understand a concept explained in class.
Other key features of the website include:
  * Chat system for students and TA's
  * Record lectures and make them available for student download
  * Transcribe lecture recordings
  * In-class quizzes
  * File sharing
